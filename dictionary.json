Achievement tests are often at the end of term or end of the year and test the main points of what has been taught in that time.\nA diagnostic test is used to identify problems that learners have with language or skills. The teacher diagnoses the language problems learners have. It can also be used to diagnose learner strengths. It helps the teacher to plan what to teach, or what not to teach, in future.\nAn objective test is marked without using the examiner\u2019s opinion, e.g. true/true questions, multiple-choice questions. There is a clear right answer.\nA placement test is often used at the beginning of a course in a language school in order to identify a learner\u2019s level of language and find the best class for them.\nA proficiency test is used to see how good learners are at using the target language. The contents of a proficiency test are not chosen according to what has been taught, but according to what is needed for a particular purpose, e.g. English for hotel receptionists, English for studying at university, English for general communication. Cambridge ESOL First Certificate in English (FCE) and IELTS are examples of proficiency tests.\nA progress test is used during a course in order to assess the learning up to a particular point in the course. \nA subjective test is marked using the examiner\u2019s opinion about the quality of the answer. The answer is not simply right or wrong, e.g. marking written stories, compositions, interviews, conversations, story-telling.\nA summative test is used at the end of a course. The focus is on the mark or grade given and feedback is not usually provided.",

Over the years, language teachers have intuitively recognized the value of associating language with physical activity. James Asher (1977) developed the Total Physical Response method from this idea. In addition to evolve around that concept, the method also combines insights from children language acquisition concepts. Asher believed that the process of learning should include a lot of reading and listening before acting. He also gave importance to \"right brained\" learning, whereas the right brain hosts motor activity. In a TPR classroom, the students would a great deal of listening and acting. The teacher would give many directives for the students perform the acting. As Asher quoted, \"The instructor is the director of a stage play in which the students are the actors.\" This over-directing attitude of the teacher was believed to reduce stress for the students, and therefore facilitate learning.",
